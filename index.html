      <p>I designed a game adapted from an old school game called <i>Dodger</i>, where players have to use their cursor to dodge items on the screen. My version of the game was a seal trying to dodge basketballs. I tried to use as much as I have learnt from all the tutorials and lecture sessions and incorporate the code into my game. </p>

      <p>I started out with the Assignment 4 code template and edited it from there.</p>

      <p>Firstly, I came up with a circus theme and came up with a back story for the main character Sally the seal. I found a seal gif and the necessary backdrop for a circus setting. I adapted the template from the NoTimerAnimation HTML for this.</p>

      <p>I styled the fonts used on the game through the use of Google fonts. I chose fonts that I felt would fit nicely to the theme and used it in my game through copying a script into the head element of my code. </p>

      <p>Then, I went to create the basketballs in an array based on the Assignment 4 code and styled them with a basketball GIF. From the Phone Sensors tutorial, I adapted the Emitter js code(nextToEmit function and Draw function) to make the basketballs fall randomly and continuously. I used mouse events to control the movement of the seal and the distance function used in Assignment 4 to determine when the game ends(when a basketball collides with the seal).</p>

      <p>From the Assignment 3 code, I applied the use of difficulty levels by changing the speed in which the basketballs drop per level. I did this through adjusting the gravity variable. By doing this, I had to change the interval in which the nextToEmit(from the Emitter code) function was called in order that the balls would fall more consistently for each level. I also adapted the use of a start button from the code and added a <i>How to play</i> button where I used animation to show the instructions. I learnt how to use the Raphaeljs function of a path to make a star from a jsfiddle.com page to style the buttons. I also added a <i>try again</i> button to reload the game and refresh the loop generating the basketballs. I found the refresh page code from a forum on www.stackoverflow.com. I did this through the use of a reset( ) function. </p>

      <p>Next, I added audio to the game based on what was learnt in the AnimatedSoundTutorial. There is audio played before the game starts, when the game starts and a short track when the player loses. They play, pause and loop at the necessary times.</p>

      <p>Following which, I added a scoreboard by using a counter and printed the score onto a div I created in the index.html. The score gets updated as time passes and it restarts each time the game reloads in the reset( ) function. The difficulty level that the player selects also gets reflected on the <i>scoreboard</i>. </p>

      <p>Lastly, I uploaded it onto github for launch under the website deblephant.github.io/savetheseal </p> </font>
